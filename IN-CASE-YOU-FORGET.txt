In case you (IceDragon) forgot how to make AUR packages:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg

1. Update PKGBUILD with new version of packages
2. makepkg -o
   To download new source files
3. `updpkgsums`
   To update md5sums
4. `makepkg` to test if package builds correctly

# this point, is for your uploading to AUR.
5. `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`
   To update the .SRCINFO
6. `git add .SRCINFO PKGBUILD
    git commit -m "YEAH"
    git push origin master
   `
7. Congrats you've updated your AUR package! :D
